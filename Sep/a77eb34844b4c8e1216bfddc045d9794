Positive psychology is a scientific approach to studying human thoughts, behaviour and feelings with a focus on strengths instead of weakness, building a good life instead of repairing a bad – “the scientific study of what makes life most worth living.” It is all about the lives of average people up to “great” instead of focusing on moving those who a struggling up to “normal.” “The aim of Positive Psychology is to catalyse a change in psychology from a preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building the best qualities in life.” – Martin Seligman. St Andrew’s College will be hosting a full day seminar on the subject on Friday 26 October 2018. Visiting guest Simon Murray will run the workshops with the aim of exploring how Positive Psychology might enhance the focus of wellbeing and pastoral care at schools.
