Photo: Lindani Donyeli Gideon Mapapu is a grandfather, ward committee member, Chairperson of the SANCO branch in Ward 3 and the Deputy Chairperson of ANC. He stays in Extension 10. Mapapu aims to set an example for the community as there is no employment in Grahamstown (Makhanda). Planting vegetables helps him to buy less, and is saving him money. He does not want to see any empty space in his yard and spends most of his free time in the garden. He helps to provide the community with small seeds so that they can grow vegetables and fruit themselves. He has noticed young people are not interested in gardening. “The youth [are]lazy”, he says. “They want to sit in the corner and watch the sun.” He wants to encourage the youth to plant. Mapapu has planted chilies, onions, beetroot, carrots, potatoes, spinach, and strawberry bush.
