Equipping children with digital literacy and digital skills is an act of great patriotism, says Deputy Minister for Communications Pinky Kekana. “For if we prepare our kids today with the skills required tomorrow, we are sure to pay it forward,” Kekana said. Addressing the South African Web Rangers Award Ceremony in Johannesburg on Saturday, she said government alone cannot move society forward as it needs the private sector, civil society and citizens to lend a hand. Web Rangers is an initiative designed to allow young people to drive safer internet behaviours within their communities through the creation of innovative campaigns that promote and champion their rights and active participation in the digital world. For the last three years, Media Monitoring Africa, has been running the programme with the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services, the Film and Publications Board, Google, Facebook, and MTN. “Together these three distinct spheres of society have created digital citizens who know how to use the internet responsibly and encourage their peers to do the same. In essence, collectively we have a tool that can address the ills or dangers that come with the digital world,” said Kekana. She said the web ranger’s programme has extended beyond the borders of South Africa. “Our Kenyan sisters and brothers have benefited from the programme.” Kekana thanked Web Rangers South Africa for being active digital citizens. “Thank you for being true patriots and flying the South African flag across the digital realm. Web Rangers South Africa the world that you want to live in is in your hands and the work you have undertaken will shape our future for the better.” – SAnews.gov.za
