Ndumiso Gora has been planting for more than ten years. He is eating through his garden. He does not believe in empty space, he chases hunger by occupying an empty space. He has planted spinach, carrots, beetroot, cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, and onions. He would appreciate it if he could be provided with more seeds to plant more.
