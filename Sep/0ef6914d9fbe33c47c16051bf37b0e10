Soci said police were negotiating with the association to re-open the road. Meanwhile, the Post Office confirmed cash payment of Sassa grants scheduled for today (19 September) in the Eastern Cape had been postponed to tomorrow 20 September 2018, as a result of the province-wide taxi strike. “A total of 19 cash paypoints scheduled for today will now be serviced tomorrow,” said Nombulelo Ngubane, regional manager for the SA Post Office in the Eastern Cape. Ngubane said a few isolated  post office branches in the province might also be unable to trade today as a result of the strike.  The branches that are affected will be posted on the Post Office’s Facebook and Twitter accounts.  The Twitter handle is @postofficesa
