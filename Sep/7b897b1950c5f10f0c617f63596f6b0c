The Grahamstown Science Café will hold its monthly meeting on Thursday, September 27 September. The speaker is Dr Anslyn John, of the Mathematics department at Rhodes University who will do a presentation on A brief history of the universe: the big bang and beyond. Members of the public are welcome, and who knows, you might soon be discussing general relativity and modified theories of gravity with a theoretical astrophysicist. The Café meets at its usual venue: Café D’Vine, 31 New Street
