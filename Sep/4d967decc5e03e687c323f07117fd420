On Tuesday 18 September 2018 the cultivation and personal use of cannabis at home was legalised in South Africa. Whether you celebrate this ruling or disagree with it, it can affect road safety. Experts have asked whether the laws and processes of detecting cannabis use in drivers will be changed and improved. The managing director of MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert, says as it stands, South Africa is not equipped to tackle the increase of cannabis use on the roads. Last year the Central Drug Authority said that cannabis use could double the number of crashes on South African roads. “An article from the US illustrated that after Washington legalised recreational use of marijuana in 2013, the number of drivers in fatal crashes who had recently used the drug more than doubles by 2014. “This means one in every six drivers involved in a fatal crash tested positive for marijuana. If a drug impairs judgment, concentration or motor skills, it can be just as dangerous to drive after consuming it, as alcohol. Along with the recent legalisation, there needs to be more focus on how it could affect drivers and other road users.” If you are not convinced, try wearing a pair of goggles which shows you how your vision is affected after using marijuana. As part of their safety initiatives, MasterDrive has goggles (which simulate impairment) which give sober-minded individuals a view of what they see after smoking the drug. There is no better lesson than seeing it for yourself. Organisations that are serious about road safety can contact MasterDrive to assist with their awareness programmes. The decision to drive under the influence of drugs should not be one made because it is now legal. “If something goes wrong because your judgment was impaired, it is you who will pay the ultimate price,” says Herbert.
