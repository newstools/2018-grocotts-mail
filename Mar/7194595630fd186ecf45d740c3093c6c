On Friday 23 February, the day of the opening of the Eastern Cape Legislature in Bisho, representatives from the Department of Arts and Culture and archivists from Port Elizabeth, King William’s Town, and the Sarah Baartman District gathered at 56 “B” Street in Grahamstown. Community members gathered at Sizwe Mda’s place. The gathering was about to rewrite the history of what happened in KwaNdacama and question why the place has a name that means “I have given up”. It was a fact-finding mission into this history.

Cultural officials from the Province seated on the grass as it used to be when gatherings take place: Nobomi Ncandana, Port Elizabeth Archives (front, right wearing pink jersey); Kholeka Jadezweni, Provincial Archives from King William’s Town (middle) and Lungiswa Mtiki, Provincial Archivist from King William’s Town (left, wearing blue dress). The aim is to get the original community who know the history of KwaNdacama to talk about it, not to rely on a history largely written by white people, said Provincial Archivist, Lungiswa Mtiki. Mtiki said oral history can thus function as a healing. Sizwe (wearing a cap) and the Community members seated on the grass The Department believes it is not the first time that such a documentation of oral history has been done, but what was done was lost. Community members put forward the names of people who are able to tell this history. The venue is Andrew Moyakhe Higher Primary School in “A” Street on Tuesday 6 March 2018 at 3pm. Everyone is welcome to attend.
