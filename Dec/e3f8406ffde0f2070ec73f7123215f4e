Staff from the Health Department’s Makana Subdistrict spent the day at the Extension 9 hall in Makana recently as part of the provincial department’s Mandela-Castro Thuma Mina Community Wellness Programme. Taking an array of healthcare services into communities, the outreach programme aims to improve maternal and child outcomes, improve access to quality healthcare in the district, upscale HIV testing and treatment, develop systems to manage the knowledge and use of traditional medicines, prevent lifestyle diseases and encourage healthy lifestyles. Spokesperson Lwandile Sicwetsha said the programme would continue across seven locations in the Sarah Baartman district.
