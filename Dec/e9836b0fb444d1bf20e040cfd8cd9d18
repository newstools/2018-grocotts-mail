File photo: Sue Maclennan Last month’s Finance, Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation portfolio committee meeting (20 November 2018) recorded positive results from measures to control expenditure and improve revenue collection. Cash flow as of 31 October 2018 showed a positive balance of R19.3 million and acting chief financial officer Colleen Mani reported that all grants and subsidies received in that month had been ring-fenced and transferred into a separate investment account. However, despite efforts made by departments to reduce overtime, Mani reported, overtime still made up 59% of employee related costs in a monthly salary budget of R14.5 million. Meanwhile, business, residents, government, councillors and staff collectively owed Makana R417.9 million. At 31 October the municipality owed R169 884 124.47 – a debt still crippling despite the R9.7m reduction since the previous month. Legal fees and related payments in October alone amounted to R205 711. Payments on long-running debts in October included R1 75 877 (Municipal Infrastructure Grant); R574 881 (Development Bank of Southern Africa loan); R1 286 788 (Water Services Infrastructure Grant). Fruitless and wasteful expenditure as at 31 October was R1 717 092.22. The bulk was made up of interest on delayed payments to: Amatola Water (R316 948.20) Eskom (R47 820; R51 358; R9 855; R72 156; R410 and R911 456); Auditor General (R11 023). The amount of R270 000 was paid in damages for a house at Egazini demolished without proper negotiations.
