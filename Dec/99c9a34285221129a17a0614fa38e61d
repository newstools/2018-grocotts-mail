Tuesday, 04 December 2018: As a result of a shortage of capacity due to a number of generating units still out of service due to breakdowns, Eskom will be implementing Stage 2 rotational loadshedding from 09:00 and this is likely to continue until 22:00. Our maintenance teams continue to work hard to bring the units back to service. Customers are reminded to treat all electrical points as live during loadshedding.  Eskom would like to sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused. Stage 2 calls for 2000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za).Eskom customers can also contact our customer contact centre at 0860 037 566.
