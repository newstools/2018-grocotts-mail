Police is warning the community to be careful if they’re trying to buy a vehicle online because they have have cases where some have been victims of scams. This came to the SAPS’ attention after an individual deposited an undisclosed amount of cash for purchasing a vehicle that he saw online. After the deposit the seller’s cellphone went to and no vehicle was ever delivered to him. Apparently, a stranger came for a test drive of the vehicle, said he liked it and then then transferred the money through telephone banking. The vehicle was given to him but when the seller went to the bank, there was no money. A case of fraud was opened and the case is still under investigation. The SAPS recommends the follow to protect yourself against such scams: NEVER send money or give credit card or online account details to anyone you do not know and trust. SAPS is committed in creating a safe and secure environment for all people in South Africa, this can only be achieved if individuals and communities cooperate with the police by volunteering information on criminals and their activities. Working together, the Police and the community can ACT, against criminal activities and perpetrators can be brought to justice.
