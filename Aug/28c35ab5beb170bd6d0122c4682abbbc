More than 800 Grahamstown (Makhanda) phone and ADSL customers were affected by damage to a Telkom line last weekend. Since Saturday 28 July, residents have shared their frustration with intermittent, slow or no internet, on social media, with some reporting it resolved by Sunday afternoon. Others were still struggling with connectivity on Tuesday. Telkom spokesperson Nomalungelo Faku confirmed the outages. “One of our main lines in the Grahamstown area was damaged by faulty power supply on Saturday 28th July,” she told Grocott’s Mail. “This impacted around 840 customers.” Faku said Telkom had been working on the issue since Saturday morning and that most customers were reconnected by 6.35pm on Sunday. “All the necessary repairs were concluded around 2pm [Tuesday 31 July],” Faku said. “Telkom apologises for the inconvenience to customers.”
