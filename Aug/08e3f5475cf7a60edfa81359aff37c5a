Grocott’s Mail is proud to be a partner in Wessa EasternCape‘s #CelebrateNaturalHeritage photography competition. Take out that camera, cellphone or tablet and get snapping! This Heritage Day, WESSA is celebrating and giving thanks for our amazing natural heritage – our natural environment. Whether that be: a glimpse of the sky through the grasses of the veld; the spectacular winter sunsets and sunrises we see each day; a garden bird caught in its daily life; or the beautiful game we find in the surrounding reserves: we are looking for your one ultimate vision of what makes you delight in your natural environmental heritage. Join in the conversation by sharing your best natural heritage photos across social media using the phrase #CelebrateNaturalHeritage. Each week we’ll pick our favourites to be featured.
