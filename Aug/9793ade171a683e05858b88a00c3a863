 On Tuesday 14 August, finalists from the Eskom Expo Regional Finals gathered at the National Settlers Monument to find out if they would be representing the Eastern Cape at the International Science Fair (ISF) on 2-5 October. The finalists were chosen on 4 August at the Regional Finals held at Rhodes University. Of the 254 registered pupils and their 187 projects, 13 went through to represent the Eastern Cape. “It has been difficult to narrow it down to 13 projects,” said Scifest Africa Manager, Pumza Tshebe.
