Sithile Ngece in his garden Sithile Ngece standing in front of his beans that he has planted Sithembile Ngece is grandfather who has tended a garden for the past 26 years. He studied Agriculture and Planting at theÂ Land Bouwer School Farmers Association near Fort Beaufort, and has since had enough confidence to grow spinach, mealies, pumpkins, beans, and nuts, among other veggies. Ngece keeps the garden going with organic manure. He would love to have a wire fence around his garden to keep vandals and stray animals away.
