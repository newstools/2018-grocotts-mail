Photo: Kathryn Cleary On Tuesday 14 August, community members eagerly gathered at the Grahamstown (Makhanda) SPCA in honour of the grand opening of the brand new clinic. In just over four months, through generous donations and support from local businesses and animal welfare organisations, the clinic became a reality. Featuring at-cost services for pet owners, Mark Thomas, SPCA Manager, hopes that the clinic will assist those who cannot afford state veterinary services.
