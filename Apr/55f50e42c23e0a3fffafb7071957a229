The children planted peas, basil, tomatoes, chilli, mealies, gooseberry bush, salad greens, and carrots. Grade R teacher Kerry Barrow said they planted the garden so that the pupils can “see growth from the garden to table, so they can see where food comes from.” They should not see food only in the market, she added. Barrow said that the Grade teachers do help with watering because the children sometimes give too much; or too little water.
