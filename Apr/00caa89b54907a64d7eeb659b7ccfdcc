A case in which a former psychiatric patient is seeking compensation for an alleged assault in hospital was postponed in the East London Regional Court last week. The allegations, together with the shock resignation of a highly experienced staff member from Cecilia Makiwane’s psychiatric unit, and the warning by the Democratic Nurses Association (Denosa) that staff shortages in Eastern Cape hospitals are putting both staff and patients at risk, have again thrown a spotlight on the crisis in psychiatric care in the province. Counsel appeared on 6 April for the Eastern Cape’s Health MEC Phumzile Dyantyi. The former patient claims that poor ward conditions contributed to their being violently assaulted by a fellow patient in the East London hospital, that they lost many teeth and were left permanently disfigured and traumatised. The incident occurred in 2013. The MEC for the Department of Health is named as the respondent. At the start of proceedings, the defence immediately called for a postponement, on the basis their expert witness was not able to attend the hearing. The MEC’s legal counsel argued that the specialist, a psychiatrist from Durban, was necessary in order to determine if the former patient was mentally capable of understanding the litigation process. The former patient’s frustration was visible at the prospect of a further delay in the case that had taken five years to come to court. The plaintiff’s legal counsel asked the court to hear the former patient’s testimony, as well as that of a subpoenaed witness. The case was postponed to 31 August. 26 March, SA Society of Psychiatrists (SASOP) President Bernard Janse van Rensburg told Grocott’s Mail that a professional staff member had recently resigned from CM’s psychiatric unit. The psychiatric wards at CM are divided into male and female sections. Both wards are completely closed, and each houses 25 acute patients of varying ages, histories and diagnoses under one roof. There are no open wards and recreation space is dismal. Recreation space at Cecelia Makiwane’s psychiatric unit.

SASOP continues to urge for the examination of the entire Eastern Cape psychiatric care referral system. This concern has also been presented to the Health Ombud. Grocott’s Mail confidentially spoke to the staff member about their resignation and comments on the Eastern Cape’s mental healthcare crisis. After 13 years, the former CM staff member resigned having expressed similar concerns to that of former Tower psychiatrist, Dr Kiran Sukeri. Sukeri’s claims originally highlighted in Rapport 4 March concern the overall management of Tower, as well as the alleged dismal and inhumane circumstances of patient care. “Management asked me to stay, but I said ‘no’, because things won’t change”, the former CM staff member stated. After 13 years of fighting for change and improvement at CM, the former staff member said, they could no longer cope. “Nothing has changed”, they emphasised. “I love the work that I do. Leaving was very hard.” The source stated that the ward conditions at CM were not suitable for psychiatric patients. The two wards had previously been used as medical wards, before housing these. “They are not designed for psych patients,” the former staff member said.  They described the patients as “difficult, acute, [and]aggressive”. Both wards are closed, with round-the-clock nurses and security. A seclusion room at Cecelia Makiwane Psychiatric Unit. The rooms are equipped with a mattress on the floor, a toilet and basin. Photo: supplied On 16 June 2017 there was a “revolt” in the male ward. The former staff member described that patients turned on each other as well as staff including nurses and security guards. The South African Police Service (SAPS) was called to defuse the violent situation. “There was no barrier,” the former staff member emphasised, because it was an “ordinary medical ward”. They further commented that acute wards typically have a barrier for the protection of nurses and staff. The revolt caused severe damage to the ward, and the majority of patients were immediately transferred to other institutions, including Tower. The incident was highly traumatic for both staff and patients, the former staff member said. The Superintendent General had visited the hospital less than week after the incident, but nothing had come as a result. They added that hospital management did not adequately address staff concerns after the traumatic incident. As result, ward nurses embarked on industrial action on 21 July 2017 in protest against the dangerous working conditions. Patients were transferred again, as there was no means to care for them. On 9 April Grocott’s Mail spoke to Khaya Sodidi, provincial Secretary of the Democratic Nurses’ Organisation of South Africa (DENOSA) who says staff shortages in Eastern Cape hospitals are putting both staff and patients at risk. “Staff are working in an unsafe environment in hospitals and clinics,” he said. Nurses working at the three local psychiatric facilities – Tower, Fort England and Cecilia Makiwane – received danger allowances, Sodidi said. This was because they work with patients who are unpredictable. “For the past few years, nurses have been asking for an increase in that danger allowance or, alternatively, an increased staff complement.” There was a shortage of staff in those institutions, Sodidi said. “For example, a unit that is supposed to be manned by three nurses – you’ll find there is only one there.” Since the incident in June 2017, CM now only takes “16 to 18 patients” per ward, as they do not have the staff capacity to manage another crisis, stated the former staff member. This specifically affects “adolescent and geriatric” patients, as the ward conditions are too unsafe. “Doctors and nurses bare the brunt”, they said. “We feel as we are letting down a community”. In 2012, the Eastern Cape province commissioned a new psychiatric hospital for Cecilia Makiwane to be built in 2015. “We were promised this stand-alone hospital”, the former staff member said. “I don’t know what happened, maybe it was too much money.” Bathroom area at Cecelia Makiwane Psychiatric Unit.

The problems at CM are at an “institutional level, even at national level”, they said. Regarding the ward conditions, the former staff member stated that “the patients are in pyjamas 24/7” and there is a television in each ward. They described highly medicated patients sitting in pyjamas in front of a television, calling it “counter-rehabilitation”. Because there is no open ward for patients to progress to, there is a “massive revolving door syndrome at Cecelia Makiwane”, in that patients come back because they have not received proper treatment. Weapons are commonly found on patients due to improper searching. Photo: supplied “It’s about considering what is the risk to the patient”, they said. They added that there is an overall failure by the “trained staff” to understand psychiatric conditions. For example weapons are commonly found on patients as security guards do not understand how to search psychiatric patients. “Basic things are not done”, they said, which impacts “general safety”.  The former staff member plans to leave the province, as the working conditions are not suitable nor healthy. “It’s the despondency that’s now amongst us”, they commented in regards to professionals who have left institutions. With Eastern Cape facilities continuing to suffer from staff shortages, overall patient care will continue to be put at risk, they said. Grocott’s Mail has approached the National Department of Health and other authoritative bodies for further information, and will continue to report on this provincial crisis.
