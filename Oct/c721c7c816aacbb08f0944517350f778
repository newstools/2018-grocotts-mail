By JESSICA EVANS George Dickerson Primary School was thrumming with music overlaid with the happy yells of its learners on the morning of Friday 14 September. It was their Grade 7 annual Entrepreneur’s Day.

Posters sprinkled the walls, advertising the wares of each class. The learners got creative and offered popular snacks like apple munch, chips and vetkoek, as well as face painting. As soon as their break began, learners from other grades flooded the quad, bunching around the stalls or waiting in lengthy lines to get their faces painted. A few Grade 7 learners even walked around the school grounds advertising the stall and selling some of the products. The learners’ excitement was palpable and throughout the break they danced to the music emanating from the second floor but for the teachers, the best part was the formation of cohesive groups for the project. “To see the teamwork, that’s just great to see,” said Knock.
