“I will give some background on the development of Green politics in Australia, which has the oldest Green party in the world, with origins in the United Tasmania Group (UTG) in 1972. “There is a misconception that Green is a middle-class concern,” Machanick said. “There are many environmental movements around the world based in poor communities. The Amadiba Crisis Committee (ACC) was started by villagers in 2007 in Xolobeni in Pondoland to fight mining titanium in their area. “Wangari Maathai in Kenya was a renowned environmentalist who won a Nobel Peace Prize.” Green politics is not about tree hugging: it is about equity and sustainability, Machanick says. The international Green movement rests on the four pillars of ecological sustainability, peace and non-violence, social justice and grassroots democracy. Machanick cited when Enrique Peñalosa became mayor of Bogotá in 1998 and put his focus on people-friendly policies that maximised equity. “He ended up with great cycling and pedestrian infrastructure and good inexpensive public transport.”
