The imminent intervention to turn Makana Municipality around, led by Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Dr Zweli Mkhize, is the fourth in as many years. Are we dizzy yet? asks Grocott’s Mail. PAM YAKO WHO Pam Yako
FROM Zenande Leadership Consulting
STATUS Section 139 (1) (b) Administrator appointed by the Provincial government
MANDATE Water; Corporate Services; Service Delivery; Finance STARTED August 2014
FINISHED 22 July 2015
HIGHLIGHTS
* Yako mobilised civil society and business in Makana, drawing together skilled individuals from the community into workstreams to tackle problem areas.
* Motivated and strengthened leadership at middle management level, building considerable good will at that tier.
* Re-awakened dormant local community leadership.
* Compiled a comprehensive financial recovery plan. LOWLIGHTS
* Some of the top management were incapable of carrying out changes.
* There was little support for Yako within a Council divided along both party and factional lines. Councillors retained the power to pass budgets. The R11-million Hlalani Multipurpose Centre was one of the budgets passed by councillors during this period.
* Money promised by other spheres of government to finance projects essential to the service delivery turnaround never materialised.
* While service delivery was one of the areas of responsibility explicitly delegated to Yako, she did not have the power to discipline officials directly responsible.
* The financial recovery plan drawn up by Yako was not implemented.
In her Intervention Final Report, Yako said, “The institutionalisation and funding of the financial recovery plan is going to be pivotal in sustaining the gains. Addressing the senior leadership challenges is also paramount and the filling of critical vacant positions has become extremely urgent. Further the need for a financial injection to help the municipality meet some of its obligations and to fund key projects in the financial recovery plan.”

HIGHLIGHTS AND LOWLIGHTS
* Improving revenue collection –  A debt collection service provider was appointed (RevCo) to assist with revenue collection and this yielded a 2 percent increase in revenue collection, bringing the percentage up to 68 percent. This was still below the industry norm of 95 percent.
* Improving supply chain management (SCM)  - A senior manager from Cogta Eastern Cape (was working in this area. However there was not enough capacity to execute the tasks.
* Addressing Litigation Challenges –  It remained a challenge to meet current obligations and service long term debt, which was in excess of R100 million.
* Improving the functioning of the Human Resources Component  – A Human Resources (HR) Manager was appointed in May 2015 and COGTA-EC also seconded a senior official in July 2015. Work on HR policies, development of an employment equity (EE) plan and ensuring compliance with prescripts was still progress.
* Improving Audit Outcomes –  An audit intervention plan had been developed but there was a need to provide strategic leadership and oversight and implementation of the Strategic Risk Assessment register was vital.
* Implementing the Financial Recovery Plan  – The Financial Recovery Plan was submitted to the Council for approval prior to March 2015 and was ready for implementation.
