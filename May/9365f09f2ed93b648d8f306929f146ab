Photo: Supplied Spar Oak Cottage have teamed up with Makana Revive in a bid to help raise funds so that they can continue the good work they are doing to re-build our battered town.  The store has been encouraging customers to consider making a small (R2) contribution as they pay for their purchases.  The programme started in mid-April and and has so far collected just over R5 000. The collection was handed over to Chairperson of Makana Revive, Ron Weissenberg, at the store this week. Jill White, owner of Spar Oak Cottage also announced that Spar would match the contributions to date so between Spar and the generosity of our customers, Makana Revive has already received R10 000 to put towards the many projects and programmes which they are currently undertaking. “We certainly hope customers continue to support this cause as ultimately it is of benefit to all of us who live in Grahamstown,”  White said.
