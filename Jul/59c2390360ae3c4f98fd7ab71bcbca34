A Kenton resident was bludgeoned with a hammer when she tried to press a panic button during a robbery on Friday night. The house, about half a kilometre west of the Kariega River, has a flat in the garden and the owner had gone outside around 8.30pm on Friday 27 July to speak to its occupant when she saw three men inside the property. SAPS spokesperson Captain Mali Govender said one of the men had a hammer in his hand and another a knife . “They ordered the people inside the house where they demanded firearms. They then took a .38 special revolver along with cellphones and a laptop,” Govender said. When the woman tried to press the panic alarm, the men stopped her and began assaulting her with the hammer, “on the head, body and arms”. She was so badly injured that she was unable to give a statement at the time. They also assaulted the tenant before fleeing on foot. As of Tuesday 31 July, there had been no new developments in the case, or arrests.
