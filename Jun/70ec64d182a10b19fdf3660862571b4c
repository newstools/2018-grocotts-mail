At right, Heemstra is with pupils and cooks at Nombulelo High School  who were delighted to receive the filters especially in light of the current water crisis.  The dual purpose filters are designed to easily fit on taps or buckets; meaning that the water can be made safe for drinking from multiple sources. Heemstra hopes to secure more funding to continue the project in the near future.
