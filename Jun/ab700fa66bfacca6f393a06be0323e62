COGTA MEC Fikile Xasa has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s signing of the proclamations authorising the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to investigate several matters involving allegations of fraud and corruption at various municipalities in the Eastern Cape. The proclamations are related to the allegations of maladministration during the funeral of Nelson Mandela funeral. The municipalities that have been mentioned to be investigated are Buffalo City, King Sabata Dalindyebo, OR Tambo and the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipalities. MEC Xasa said the investigations will provide an opportunity to all affected individuals to come forward and clear themselves. He called for effective coordination of efforts to expose and prosecute those involved. “We must bring closure to this matter especially as it takes place in the year in which we celebrate the Centenary of Nelson Mandela. All wrong doers must face the full might of the law without fear or favour. Acts of corruption, collusion and other criminal activities in the private and public sector, must be fought with equal diligence and determination,” said Xasa. He added that communities had started to take up the fight against acts of fraud and corruption through protest actions to highlight lack of service delivery including allegations of rampant acts of maladministration and misuse of public resources. “We call on our leaders to distance themselves from any forms of maladministration by taking charge of community complaints and stop waiting for outside help. We encourage municipal leadership to implement without fail the recommendations of forensic investigations that have been undertaken in their municipalities. Government is taking a dim view of the non-implementation of such recommendations by municipalities, which appears to be a trend,” he said.
MEC Xasa said the fight against fraud and corruption remains an important priority if government is to provide sustainable services to communities.
