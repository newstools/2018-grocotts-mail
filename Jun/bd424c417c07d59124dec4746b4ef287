With just two weeks to go to the 2018 edition of the National Arts Festival, Thembinkosi ‘Tbag’ Mdyogolo of the Makana Traffic Department paints road-marking lines on Somerset Street opposite the Drostdy Arch on Thursday 14 June. Work is under way to spruce up the city ahead of the 11-day event which begins on 28 June and ends Sunday 8 July. With performances, lectures, exhibitions and workshops across 90 venues, it is Africa’s largest multi-arts festival, attracting more than 200 000 visitors, who are here for more than 2 000 performances on a programme of more than 700 events.
