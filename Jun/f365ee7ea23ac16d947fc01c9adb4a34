Makana Municipality’s Traffic Department recently acquired an automatic number plate recognition system to help them trace offenders with outstanding summonses and warrants of arrest. “It scans number plates and alerts us to offenders,” said Traffic head Coenraad Hanekom. Members of the public were advised to check at the Makana Traffic Office for any outstanding matters that could see them arrested at the side of the road. Photo: Supplied
